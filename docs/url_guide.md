# Guide to Character Download Links

On KFO, you are able to set and obtain download links for custom characters!

There are two sections to this guide:

1. [Finding Download Links](#finding-download-links)
2. [Setting Download Links](#setting-download-links)

## Finding Download Links

First, you should know where to find the links that were set by other users/the server!

### Method 1: Finding links in KFO-Client DL Manager

1. Click Main -> DL Manager (Ctrl+G) or press Settings -> DL Manager tab

    ![opening dl manager](url_guide/image.png)

2. Set the "Authority" dropdown to either User-Shared, or Server-Shared

3. **Double-Click** any link in the list to open it in your browser!

### Method 2. Using OOC commands

1. Run `/get_link` command to get all the URLs in your current area
2. Run `/get_links` command to get all the URLs in the whole hub (must be able to run `/getareas` for this command)
3. Click on the URLs that were posted in your OOC for anyone you're missing content for!

## Setting Download Links

Next, we'll teach you how to actually set these content URL links!

### Method 1: Using Download.ini file

You don't necessarily have to have the client open for this one, but it allows you to automatically make the `Download.ini` in your current character folder (that file simply contains the download link inside of it)

1. Click Character -> Download.ini -> Set Download Link

    ![setting download link](url_guide/image-2.png)

2. In the new pop-up, paste in your link (note that it must begin with http or it won't work)

    ![link popup](url_guide/image-3.png)

3. The link will be broadcast to everyone using an OOC message, and anyone will also be able to follow the [Finding Download Links](#finding-download-links) step to see it again!

(If you want to reset the Download Link you can press "Delete File". However, you still need to run an ooc command `/set_url` by itself to clear the link due to a client bug not transmitting the URL being cleared.)

### Method 2: Using OOC Commands

You don't have to create a `Download.ini` file locally to set a character link.

1. In OOC, run the command `/set_url https://example.com` where you swap out the link with your character's download link
2. The link will be broadcast in OOC, and also be available by all the normal methods following the [Finding Download Links](#finding-download-links) step!

## Words of Caution

User links are not vetted in any way! Please exercise caution downloading files off the internet from people you don't know.
